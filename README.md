## Project Overview
This project analyzes the economic growth of East African Community (EAC) countries, focusing on key metrics such as GDP, GDP per capita, political indicators, and foreign direct investment (FDI) from 2005 to 2022. The analysis includes Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, providing a comprehensive view of their economic development within the EAC.

## Motivation and Objectives
The motivation for this project arises from the need to understand the differences in economic growth among EAC countries. By analyzing GDP, political stability, and FDI, we provide insights into how these factors influence development.

# Objectives

## Objective A: Economic Development Comparison
1. Analyze **GDP**, **GDP growth rates** and **GDP per capita** across EAC countries from 2005 to 2022.
2. Identify disparities in economic growth among the EAC nations and propose actionable insights for fostering **equitable development**.

## Objective B: Feature Correlations
1. Investigate correlations between **political indicators and FDI**  and economic performance.

## Objective C: Political Analysis
1. Assess the influence of **political stability** and **governance** on economic growth rates in EAC countries.
2. Analyze the correlation between **governance indicators** (e.g., control of corruption, rule of law) and economic performance.

## Objective D: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analysis
1. Examine **FDI trends** in EAC countries and their impact on economic growth.


## Data Sources and Timeline

The data for this project was sourced from the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org). The analysis timeline spans from 2005 to 2022.

## Tools

- **Excel**: For initial cleaning and arranging of data.
- **Python**: Used for data analysis and manipulation.
  - Libraries:
    - `Pandas`: For data handling and analysis.
    - `Plotly`: For interactive visualizations.
    - `Matplotlib`: For creating static visualizations.
    - `Seaborn`: For advanced statistical graphics.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting the analysis process and visualizing data.


## Project Workflow
1. Data collection from reliable sources such as the World Bank and UNESCO.
2. Initial data cleaning and organization using Excel.
3. In-depth analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to create visualizations and interpret trends.
4. Creation of visual summaries to illustrate findings, including GDP growth rates, FDI trends, and political stability indicators.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Key Insights
- **GDP Growth Rates**: Between **2005 and 2022**, **Rwanda** achieved the highest GDP growth rate of **7.27%**, while **Burundi** experienced the lowest GDP growth rate of **2.55%**, highlighting significant economic disparities within the region.

- **GDP Per Capita**: In **2022**, **Kenya** had the highest GDP per capita at **1,755 USD**, followed by **Tanzania** at **1,058 USD**. In contrast, **Burundi's GDP per capita** dropped by **-11.19%D**, indicating severe economic challenges that need addressing.

- **Political Stability Scores**: **Rwanda's** improvement in political stability is notable, with a score change from **-1.00 in 2005 to 0.031 in 2022**, representing a **103.1%** increase. This positive trend correlates with its robust economic growth.



  - **Corruption Control**: **Rwanda** also improved its control of corruption score from **-0.629 in 2005 to 0.561 in 2022**, marking a **189.19%** improvement. In comparison, **Burundi's score** worsened from **-0.957 to -1.518**, showing a **58.62%** decline, which aligns with its negative economic growth.

  
  
- **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**: **Tanzania** and **Uganda** showed strong connections between FDI and economic performance, with average FDI of **1,194.28 million USD** and **1,027.89 million USD**, respectively. Their average GDP growth rates were **5.87%** and **5.86%**, highlighting the critical role of foreign investment in economic development.

  

  
### Recommendations
1. **Improve Governance in Burundi**: Strengthen political stability in Burundi, which has the lowest political stability score at -1.189 (2022), to support economic growth.
2. **Attract Foreign Investment in Tanzania and Uganda**: Create clear rules and incentives to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI). Tanzania and Uganda have the highest average FDI at 1,194.28 million USD and 1,027.89 million USD, respectively.
3. **Reduce Corruption in Kenya and Uganda**: Implement measures to lower corruption. Kenya's corruption score improved from -1.013 in 2005 to -0.760 in 2022, while Uganda's score worsened from -0.834 to -1.042, indicating a need for better governance.
4. **Encourage Regional Cooperation**: Promote collaboration among EAC countries (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) to share resources and best practices for balanced development, as disparities in GDP growth rates indicate uneven progress.
5. **Invest in Education Across the Region**: Focus on improving education and skills training in all EAC countries to prepare the workforce for new job opportunities, particularly in Burundi, where GDP per capita is the lowest at 262.00 USD (2022).
.

## Limitations
This analysis has several limitations that should be considered:
- **Incomplete Country Coverage**: Not all countries in the East African Community (EAC) were included due to missing data, particularly for South Sudan, limiting comprehensive comparisons.
- **Omitted Indicators**: Key factors such as **infrastructure development**, **access to education**, and **health metrics** were not analyzed, which could significantly impact economic growth and development outcomes.
- **External Influences**: Global economic trends and local policies may also impact the findings and interpretations of this analysis.

## Impact and Future Plans
The insights gained from this project can **inform policymakers and stakeholders** in the EAC to implement effective strategies for economic development.
Future plans include expanding the analysis to incorporate additional metrics and exploring the impact of **socio-economic factors**. The project is dedicated to improving the understanding of economic dynamics in the region and aims to **create interactive dashboards** for better visualization of data, thereby enhancing accessibility and engagement with the findings.
