## Project Overview
This project analyzes the economic growth of East African Community (EAC) countries, focusing on key metrics such as GDP, GDP per capita, political indicators, and foreign direct investment (FDI) from 2005 to 2022. The analysis includes Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, providing a comprehensive view of their economic development within the EAC.

## Motivation and Objectives
The motivation for this project arises from the need to understand the differences in economic growth among EAC countries. By analyzing GDP, political stability, and FDI, we provide insights into how these factors influence development.

## Objectives
1. Examine **GDP growth rates** and trends in EAC countries from 2005 to 2022, identifying key drivers of economic change.
2. Investigate the correlation between **political indicators**, such as governance and stability, and their influence on economic growth.
3. Assess the role of **foreign direct investment (FDI)** in shaping economic performance and growth trajectories in the EAC region.
4. Evaluate the impact of **GDP per capita** on overall economic well-being and development in the EAC countries.
5. Identify disparities in economic growth among the EAC nations and propose actionable insights for fostering **equitable development**.

## Data Sources and Timeline
The data for this project was sourced from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). The analysis timeline spans from 2005 to 2022.

## Tools
- **Excel**: For initial cleaning and arranging of the data.
- **Python**: For data analysis and processing, using libraries such as:
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## Project Workflow
1. Data collection from reliable sources such as the World Bank and UNESCO.
2. Initial data cleaning and organization using Excel.
3. In-depth analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to create visualizations and interpret trends.
4. Creation of visual summaries to illustrate findings, including GDP growth rates, FDI trends, and political stability indicators.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Key Insights
1. **GDP Growth**: Rwanda showed the highest GDP growth rate (7.27%), while Burundi struggled with the lowest rate (1.92%).
2. **GDP Per Capita**: Kenya had the highest average GDP per capita (1,443.87 USD), while Burundi had the lowest (265.09 USD).
3. **Political Stability**: Countries like Rwanda improved political stability scores (from -1.00 to 0.03), resulting in higher economic growth.
4. **FDI Impact**: Tanzania and Uganda received the highest FDI inflows, correlating with their higher growth rates (5.87% and 5.86%, respectively).
5. **Control of Corruption**: Rwanda's improvement in corruption control (189% increase) aligned with its GDP growth, highlighting the importance of governance.

### Recommendations
1. **Burundi**: Focus on enhancing **political stability** and governance to foster economic growth. Improving political stability by at least 20% could significantly boost GDP.
2. **Kenya**: Strengthen **anti-corruption efforts** and **rule of law** to maintain growth momentum and stabilize political conditions further.
3. **Rwanda**: Continue leveraging governance improvements, aiming to attract **more FDI** to sustain its high growth rate of 7.27%.
4. **Tanzania and Uganda**: **Encourage FDI** through incentives and stable regulatory frameworks, considering their positive growth correlation with higher FDI inflows.
5. **Overall EAC**: Promote regional cooperation to share best practices in governance and economic development for **balanced growth**.

## Limitations
- The analysis could not include all EAC countries, as **South Sudan** had missing data on key metrics like GDP and political stability. 
- Some other relevant indicators, such as **education levels** and **infrastructure quality**, were not included but could impact economic development.

## Impact and Future Plans
The insights from this project can help **policymakers** and **stakeholders** in the EAC implement strategies for economic development. Future plans include:
- Expanding the analysis to cover **additional socio-economic indicators**, such as education and infrastructure.
- Creating **interactive dashboards** for real-time tracking and visualizing economic trends.
